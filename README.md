Sixth commit

Trains the network by adjusting weights and biases in order to produce output.
Applied new algorithm that adjusts the weights and biases taking into account all training samples
The network is almost perfect when it has structure of X:5:10:Y where X and Y are determined by the data
Goes off of the data used for fives(data for 5 and not 5) at the moment
To have new data, change the answer index to get the right answer taken out and used and then specify the the amount of neurons and epochs and learnRate
